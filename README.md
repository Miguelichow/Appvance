# Appvance
This is my final degree project. It is an Android application to track your workouts, diet plan, weights and measurements 
during the weeks. 
Also it includes a tool that you can use to calculate your daily food intake based in a portion system instead of 
calories counting, simplifying it.
You will only have to add some data like your height, weight, age and the app will give you the amount of portions that
you have to eat depending of your goals.

## Getting Started

Download the repository to your local computer.

### Prerequisites
Android Studio is required to build and run the project.

You maybe need to install Genymotion if your computer is AMD based.

```
Android Studio
Genymotion
```

## TODO
  It **only works with a _Google Pixel 2 XL emulator_**, so next steps will be to use Scalable DP to adapt the interface to all
  devices densities.
